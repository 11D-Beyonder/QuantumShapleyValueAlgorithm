## Abstract

In the classical context, the cooperative game theory concept of the
Shapley value has been adapted for post hoc explanations of Machine
Learning (ML) models. However, this approach does not easily translate to
eXplainable Quantum ML (XQML). Finding Shapley values can be highly
computationally complex to implement. We propose quantum algorithms
which can extract Shapley values in within some confidence interval.
Our results perform in polynomial time. We demonstrate the validity of
each approach under specific examples of cooperative voting games.
